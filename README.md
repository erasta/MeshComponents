# MeshComponents
Split mesh into connected components online

https://erasta.github.io/MeshComponents/

Suppose you have a mesh that has multiple components that are not connected.

This app will load (locally) the mesh from an STL file and analyze it.

Then each component will be colored differently and you'll be able to write them into separate STL files.

Clicking on a component will de-select it for writing.
